# CNU Course Charter
**This program is currently not affiliated with or owned by CNU.**

CNU Course Charter is a browser-based program that allows users to visualize and plan out schedules for class registration. Users can upload the schedule of classes for the current semester as a CSV file; once the program has the schedule of classes, users can search for classes using either the course registration number (CRN), a unique identifier for classes, or the class registration name (XXXX 123 - ex. CHEM 122).

Once the user finds the classes they are looking for, they can add the class to their list of courses (the bottom container on the left) by clicking on any search result. Once a course has been added to the user's list of courses, they can click on any course in the list to add it to the schedule. The program displays the user's schedule using a similar format to Google Calendar, using timeblocks. Courses are color-coded to help the user quickly and easily differentiate between academic subjects.

Below is a demo screenshot of the program.
