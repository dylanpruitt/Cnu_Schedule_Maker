            <h2>Getting the Schedule of Classes as a CSV file</h2>
            <p>To be able to use this program, you'll need to upload the current schedule of classes as a CSV file. This part of the guide will
                show you how to get a CSV file for classes.
            </p>
            <p>First, you need to go to the CNU Schedule of Classes website. You can get there by going to the CNU Live login page, and clicking on
                the "Schedule of Classes" link.
            </p>
            <img src="Images/getting-csv-1.PNG"></img>
            <p>Next, use the website to search for the classes you will be using in your schedule. You should end up at a screen like this:</p>
            <img src="Images/getting-csv-2.PNG"></img>
            <p>Once you have searched for all of the classes you want to use (you can leave the search blank to get all of the classes for the
                upcoming semester), click "Export to Excel (CSV)" - see above. This will download the class data as a CSV file. Make sure to keep
                track of where your CSV file is - you will need it to use this program.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="uploading-csv">
            <h2>Uploading your CSV file to the program</h2>
            <p>Go to the program website, and click on the button labeled "choose file" (see picture).</p>
            <img src="Images/uploading-csv.PNG"></img>
            <p>Find the CSV file that you downloaded earlier, and choose to upload that to the website. If the file uploaded properly,
                the text next to the button should be whatever your file is named, instead of "No file chosen".
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="search-engine">
            <h2>The search engine and you</h2>
            <p>Now that you've uploaded the CSV file, you can finally use the search engine to look at your options. You can use the
                box in the top left (see picture below) to enter the CRN (a 4 digit number for your class, if you've written them down)
                or search by a class's registration name (examples would be HONR 020 and SPAN 201; it should look like ABCD 123).
            </p>
            <img src="Images/search-engine-1.PNG"></img>
            <p>You can also search for multiple class subjects at the same time by putting a semicolon ";" between each entry, like in
                the example below. This allows you to pick out courses you want from just one search, instead of having to do multiple searches
                for different subjects.</p>
            <img src="Images/search-engine-2.PNG"></img>
            <p>Under the box for you to enter your search query, you can also use filters to apply to your search. By default, the program will
                only return classes with available seats as results, so that you don't find yourself making a schedule out of closed courses.
                You can filter courses by different days by typing in the different days in a format like "TR" or "MWF", meaning that the program
                will only return courses on Tuesday/Thursday, or Monday/Wednesday/Friday, respectively.
                You can also filter courses by teacher and LLC requirements - there is an option to search for multiple teachers at once, using the 
                same format as multiple subjects in the search bar. By typing in "teacher name 1;teacher name 2; teacher name 3; etc." you are able to
                filter multiple teachers at once.
            </p>

            <p>
                After you have applied filters and filled out the search box, click on the button labelled "Search" to search for your classes. The
                search results should show up in the box below. Now that you've searched for your classes, it's time
                to make your schedule.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="making-a-schedule">
            <h2>Making a schedule</h2>
            <p>You can click on any of the search results that you get to add that class to your schedule. If there is a set time for it (the class
                should say "(Arranged)" otherwise, the class will now show up to the right. To remove a class from your schedule, simply click the "X"
                on any of the classes in the right (see picture).
            </p>

            <p>Classes are color coded by different subjects, to help you tell them apart.</p>
